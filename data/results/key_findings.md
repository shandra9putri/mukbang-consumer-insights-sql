Limitations & Future Research

Study Limitations

- **Cross-sectional design:** Captures snapshot in time, cannot establish causation definitively
- **Self-reported data:** Purchase behavior based on recall, not observed transactions
- **Single influencer focus:** Results specific to Tzuyang, may not generalize to all mukbang creators
- **Geographic scope:** South Korean market only

Recommended Future Research
1. **Longitudinal study:** Track consumers over 6-12 months to measure sustained impact
2. **Multi-influencer comparison:** Test if findings hold across different mukbang creators
3. **Actual sales data:** Link survey responses to real transaction data for validation
4. **Cross-cultural study:** Examine if mukbang marketing effectiveness varies by country
5. **Content analysis:** Investigate which video elements (food types, presentation style) drive strongest impact

DON'T:
